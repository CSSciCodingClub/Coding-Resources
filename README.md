# Coding Resources

## Learning
A good way to learn is by solving [Coding Challenges][#coding-challenge-websites], but in addition there are also a variety of books and courses that can help you get started:
- [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science by David Malan at Harvard University](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- Downey, Allen B. (2016). [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) (2nd ed.). O'Reilly Media.
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) and [Learn More Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/more-python-book/) by Zed Shaw.
- [Python for the humanities](http://www.karsdorp.io/python-course/) by Folgert Karsdorp, or expanded as [book](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis).
